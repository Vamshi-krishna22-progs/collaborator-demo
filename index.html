<p>A paragraph is a group of sentences that develop one main idea. It typically includes a topic sentence, supporting sentences, and sometimes a concluding sentence. Paragraphs help organize writing, making it easier for readers to follow the flow of ideas. They can be short or long, but should maintain focus on a single topic. </p>
